# testapi

This is package meant to be used for e2e testing of apid

Everything except the main is in an [`internal` package](https://golang.org/doc/go1.4#internalpackages) so that 
we don't something of it in production by mistake

See `cmd/main.go` for all the available endpoints

## Running E2E tests
In the root of `apid`:
```console
make e2e
```
