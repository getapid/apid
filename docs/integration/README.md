# Integration

APId is easily integratable with your CI tool of choice. You can add it as an extra step in your pipeline using either the official CLI binary, or the latest docker image.

Here are a few examples with the most common CI solutions out there:

- [CircleCI](integration/circleci.md)
- [Drone](integration/drone.md)
- [Github actions](integration/github.md)
- [Jenkins](integration/jenkins.md)
- [TravisCI](integration/travis.md)
